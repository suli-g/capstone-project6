# Final Capstone Project
This program supposes that people are thinking about launching rockets into orbit using a device that spins the rocket using until its centripetal acceleration
reaches earth's escape velocity. It produces a scatter plot that plots Centripetal acceleration against the radius of motion (length of the 'arm' used to spin the rocket),
along with a regression line and prediction line. The prediction line could be changed into a line that indicates a positive vs negative effect on the vehicle being flung
into space. 

Dependencies:
* Python 3.5 (due to typing)
* numpy
* matplotlib
* sci-kit learn
